# STEM-IoT-Resilience
Resilience is the development of skills needed to manage stress in an optimal way and buffer individuals from the development of suicidality in the face of risk factors or stressors. The World Health Organization (WHO) advocates for resilience at individual and community levels by recognizing the role of protective factors relative to suicide risk factors. Protective factors include development of social support systems, positive coping skills, good self-esteem, self-efficacy and effective problem-solving skills. To further the concept of a social support system, a multi-tiered learning approach uses technology to illustrate the development of a personal social support through visual programming objects, Node-RED. These objects are used to construct an application that allows a person to contact members of that personâ€™s social support system using Internet of Things (IoT). By understanding the roles that programming objects play to create a system, the person also recognizes the distinct roles people play within support systems and the importance of communication with people. This exercise has been used at 8th grade level.
